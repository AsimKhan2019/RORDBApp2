# RORDBApp2 

The purpose of the application is to test whether the user can sign into the application without the need to create 
a new database and simply use the admin profiles and postgresql database from the first RORDBApp1 application. 

This is to test whether the distributed applications can use the same database and the models and perform different 
tasks and operations.
